Mike and I helped load the adult, female Pp into the back of Dr. Raverty's pickup truck for transport. No other visible signs of trauma on the carcass or fins. The pectoral fins were starting to peal from exposure. On 8-12-06, Dr. Raverty sent an e-mail stating that the Pp died of a severe fungal infection in her lungs due to Cryptococcus gattii. Dr. Raverty will have a more complete report on the Pp this next week. I called Lynne Barre, Dr. S. Norman, Susan B., Birch Bay State Park Ranger, Jason and the reporting party Nancy K., to notify them of the possible health hazard of the Harbor Porpoises. Also, if any other porpoises should show up in the area, to call me immediately.

Susan and Marty responded in gale force winds and driving rain the morning of 11/21/06, found the porpoise and commandeered two young construcion workers to help haul it back to the car. Part of one side of the face has been scavenged, the body is intact though a bit bloated. Due to extreme weather conditions, two quick photos and GPS readings were taken on the beach, then we hauled it to the car. Susan later measured the porpoise, but could not access the porpoise in the back of the car well enough to determine gender or do a full examination.

Earlier it had been deposited by high tide approximately 12 feet up onto the beach, per neighbors. They (neighbors) carried it back into the water, but it returned to the water's edge. SD observed it rolling around in the surf on it's sides and often on it's back, making not attempt to right itself. It would take an occasional breath/blow when it's blowhole was out of the water. Expecting the animal to die before long, SD secsecured it with a slack rope from the flukes to driftwood. At 8:30pm, a neighborcalled to say it was now exposed on the beach, but still breathing. Plans were made to collect the carcass at 7:30am 9/9/06. MK and SD were at the site at 7:30am 9/9/06. The porpoise was still breathing, but in distress. It was wrapped in a tarp and trasported to Penn Cove Veterinary Clinic where it was euthanized by L. Gustafson, DVM, at 8:30 am. The animal showed wrinkled skin. Blood was drawn, post euthanasia. the necropsy was performed by Dr. S. Norman, C. Spehar, M. Klope, and S. Dubpernell, at 10:00am. Samples were taken for Dr. Stephen Raverty, J. Calambokidis, B. Hanson, and the tissue bank.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","-0.185236932203395","0.536885737704914","-122.28","48.1268857377049","Phocoena phocoena",2006-09-01,0.309274,0.0235695,0.124759,0.208015,0.53,-0.12951492,1.04,NA,13.94,192.4128,61.4344,NA,NA,"El Nino",0.008,-0.12339385,0.48,NA,11.919,187.2317,43.0901,NA,NA,"El Nino",-0.621,-0.5670332,0.4,11.97,11.071,77.8645,-4.9755,1.25972,NA,"La Nina",-0.533,-0.711524,0.05,11.381,10.19,-35.8389,-137.562,2.00431,5.313298,"La Nina",NA,0.248863636,NA,-0.374045455,0.986958333,0.33235,0.165333333,0.0741,0.35582858,0.110138156,-0.12497515,0.036378242,0.17520729,0.045525607,0.18079934,0.17680886,"Fall","Other"

Seeing dogs around it she dragged it up onto her lawn. SB and SD responded and found a rounded triangular shape, slab-like, black and white specimen that may have been part of an orca or Dall's porpoise. The specimen measured 86 cm at its longest dimension by 60 cm at the widest part. Thickness ranged from 1cm to 3 cm approximately. The top surface had a white patch surrounded on two sides by a shiny black border ranging from 5 to 8"" wide approx. The underside showed some muscle tissue. The blubber layer, at its thickest part measured 2.5 cm. There were 3 small bones stuck to the underside. One was pulled out an measured approx. 6"" in length. On one side of the specimen there were 4 semi-circular notches or bites and in one corner there was a short, clean, knife-like cut. The specimen was collected, bagged with ice and delivered to Brad Hanson for identification. Upon initial visual exam Brad Hanson determined the specimen to be a portion of the underside of a Dall's porpoise.","Dalls porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","-0.0952369322034059","0.13488573770492","-122.37","47.992","Phocoenoides dalli",2007-10-01,0.0719958,0.161659,0.285407,0.0882064,-0.288,1.229531,0.78,NA,16.177,148.4023,28.2431,NA,-1.219459,"La Nina",-0.215,1.2335978,0.09,10.749,14.055,209.1233,14.1568,-5.58815,-1.159497,"La Nina",0.247,0.69090426,-0.1,10.109,11.412,185.3527,48.9892,-5.34845,-3.941081,"El Nino",0.015,0.26091993,0.16,10.126,10.51,132.0192,-2.7801,-4.73315,0.688811,"El Nino",NA,2.472409091,-0.30188,0.363863636,-0.959043478,-0.881045455,-0.857041667,-0.22865,-0.25669026,0.020113118,0.08292858,0.19364926,0.036174845,0.00027,0.14115173,-0.12507625,"Fall","Other"

Very young animal. Teeth not erupted yet. No obvious signs of cause of death. Blubber was in good shape and good depth suggesting a quick death that did not tax metabolism. Lungs had blood in them with a lot of bubbles (froth) coming from the bronchioles - look similar to spit bug masses. Photos were taken as well as samples for histology that will be sent to Dr. Raverty. Raverty results: lack of milk suggests not nursing. Massive hemorrhage in adrenal gland is similar to finding in adults with protozoal infection from Sarcocystis neurona or Toxoplasma gondii however IHC staining showed no detectable parasites. Another possibility suggested was a septicemia.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1414415904762","-124.188283641509","0.46921635849057","-0.164058409523811","-124.6575","48.3055","Phocoena phocoena",2008-10-01,0.0419517,0.200486,0.126399,0.057719,0.054,1.4274336,-1.67,11.601,11.409,167.3208,48.9607,-4.68589,-3.360594,"El Nino",0.133,1.280057,-1.34,9.242,12.283,288.121,42.7619,-6.68289,-3.081528,"El Nino",-0.368,1.7382193,-1.37,9.65,11.526,273.5483,37.2803,-6.30837,-3.025437,"La Nina",-0.874,1.3968322,-1.52,9.3,9.331,130.2347,7.7472,-4.22837,-0.312117,"La Nina",-0.279869565,-2.295590909,-1.80888,-1.408136364,-1.418043478,-0.767045455,-1.683041667,-1.40765,0.36875138,-0.17820077,-0.07878253,-0.22064333,0.22049707,-0.21075602,0.30127394,-0.21489106,"Fall","Other"

It was on the beach just NW of the Lagoon Point boat ramp. She pulled it above the tide level and Howard Garrett and Susan Berta responded to collect the carcass. It appeared to be fairly fresh and intact, with some scavenging around the right eye and jaw area (Lynn remarked that the scavenging occurred after she had initially examined the animal several hours earlier. ) The carcass also had small scavenging marks on the skin near the fluke area from a swarm of yellow jacket bees that were on the carcass. We bagged the carcass and delivered it to the CPSMMSN freezer at S. Dubpernell's for future necropsy. Necropsy Report Results: ""The proximate cause of death of this animal is attributed to the bronchopneumonia and intralesional coccobacilli. Aerobic cultures of the lungs yielded heavy growth of Actinomyces sp and E. Coli, the former which is considered significant.""

Necropsy findings: Based on the age of the animal, it is difficult to resolve whether the suboptimal nutritional status may be related to in utero or possibly post partum malnutrition.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.4110768823529","-122.4657632875","-0.0907632875000104","0.0930768823529391","-122.375","48.318","Phocoena phocoena",2009-08-01,0.00938998,0.138635,0.329128,0.287237,0.361,0.5557519,-0.88,9.912,10.874,190.2336,3.2407,-4.39315,-1.883737,"El Nino",-0.109,0.417697,-1.65,9.141,9.634,170.7162,30.4379,-5.80819,-1.937552,"La Nina",-0.678,0.33323184,-1.59,10.323,9.344,109.9466,-22.6698,-4.51882,1.356662,"La Nina",-0.677,0.9129716,-1.55,10.497,8.989,-68.779,-51.4027,2.17288,1.243049,"La Nina",-1.156043478,-1.419045455,-1.842041667,-1.10465,-0.892666667,-0.7719,-0.930333333,-1.149736842,0.20320818,-0.1348801,0.115707286,-0.1963855,0.12855712,-0.17050077,0.62426823,-0.2968229,"Summer","Other"

She first reported it as an orca calf but from her description on the phone (3.5 -4 feet long, black and white) we thought it was more likely a Dall's porpoise calf. They discovered it 100 feet from the stairs to the beach at Double Bluff Park,Freeland wrapped in seaweed. They had plastic trash bags with them so packed it in the bags and left it near the steps while responders headed down to collect it. Upon examination,responders found a harbor porpoise calf in good condition. A few small scrapes and one cut, or possible scavenger peck on the left jaw and some skin beginning to peel.There was a foamy discharge coming from the blowhole. A small sample of that was collected in a syringe. The porpoise was put on ice in a large cooler awaiting necropsy scheduled for July 10. Necropsy July 10, 2009. Age neonate. 87 cm from tip of snout to fluke notch. Girth at front of dorsal fin: 46.9 cm. Blubber: dorsal 1 cm, lateral 1.3 cm, ventral 1.4 cm. Blubber samples frozen for Brad Hanson , MML, and Pace Labs for dioxin testing. Good post mortem condition. Scavenging on neck and left eye. Poor nutritional condition. Flukes and dorsal fin still folded. No parasites noted. Teeth not yet erupted. Pink tinged foam coming from blowhole.o Primary incision: thorax contained red-tinged clearish fluid, apprx 5 ml. Blubber yellow, icteric. Foam in airways. Trachea contained small amount yellow tinged foam. Lungs floated. Stomach contents: meconium. Collected and frozen. Bladder empty. Comments: caldftook breaths. Umbilical stump still attached. No evidence of nursing. Calf approx 1-2 days old. No gross visible signs of trauma, infection or other physical abnormalities. Cause of dearth:unknown. Complete sets of tissues collected frozen and formalin for analysis. Necropsy results from Dr. Norman: poor nutritional condition. Neonate had taken breath before expiring. Necropsy results from Dr. Raverty: the aspirated squames and meconiom are suggestive of fetal distress type syndrome and in conjunction with the lack of ingesta in the gastrointestinal tract, would have been sufficiently severe to account for the lack of this neonate. No microscopic indication of any infectious or inflammatory process.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","0.0492440677966073","0.145527737704917","-122.514481","47.981358","Phocoena phocoena",2009-07-01,0.00938998,0.138635,0.329128,0.287237,-0.109,0.417697,-1.65,9.141,9.634,170.7162,30.4379,-5.80819,-1.937552,"La Nina",-0.678,0.33323184,-1.59,10.323,9.344,109.9466,-22.6698,-4.51882,1.356662,"La Nina",-0.677,0.9129716,-1.55,10.497,8.989,-68.779,-51.4027,2.17288,1.243049,"La Nina",-0.726,0.72193635,-1.4,10.93,9.327,52.4224,-35.1876,-3.62911,0.513324,"La Nina",-1.842041667,-1.10465,-0.892666667,-0.7719,-0.930333333,-1.149736842,-0.71816,-1.029333333,0.115707286,-0.1963855,0.12855712,-0.17050077,0.62426823,-0.2968229,0.53301114,-0.38218355,"Summer","Other"

Necropsy Sept. 20, 2009. Norman et al. Code 3 carcass. Left side of head and shoulder area extensively scavenged, Dorsal fin folded over. Left pectoral fin hanging by small amount of tissue. Teeth unerupted. Generalized cracking and scaling of skin. Body condition fair. Blubber: dorsal 5mm, lateral 5mm, ventral 6 mm. Stomach empty except for a small whitish object (unidentified). Complete set of tissues taken for further analysis. Blubber samples frozen in foil for possible test for dioxins/furans. Photos of necropsy at CPSMMSN archives No significant findings COD: unknown at this time. Necropsy findings: Based on the apparent age of this animal (neonate)), the accumulation of aspirated squames and meconium throughout the lungs is suggestive of a fetal distress type syndrome, possibly related to dystochia, premature placental detachment or some other process.

As the responders prepared to investigate, Ken called back at 11:36 after talking with the neighbors - they reported it had been swimming circles a short time before and Ken was unsure if the porpoise was still alive, or had died. Responders arrived on the scene at approx 11;45 and the porpoise was about 5' from the water's edge, floating upright, but no longer moving. The mouth was slightly ajar. They brought it to the beach and confirmed that it had died. The neighbors who had seen it earlier that morning reported it as alive and swimming in circles near the beach at 10:54 AM. They took photos at that time which they will send to CPSMMSN. A neighbor said he had seen it yesterday swimming around in the same area. The carcass was collected and transported to the SN necropsy facility where it was necropsied later that afternoon 1/1/11. Necropsy performed on still warm fresh carcass on 1/1/11 by Dr. S.Norman et al. Some ulcerated lesions were seen externally around the mouth and ovoid shaped whitish gray marks on lateral surface. Tubercles were seen on upper edge of dorsal fin. Rake marks on base of peduncle. Multiple (>100) disseminated, 2-3 mm bright yellow, calcified nodules in fascia beneath blubber layer along dorsum and lateral sides of thorax and abdomen -possible parasitic cysts. Firm 3mm diameter lesions in bronchi and bronchiolar spaces, tannish in color. Substantial foam noted in bronchi and trachea. 12-14 cm fish located in esophagus proximal to gastroesophageal sphincter. Stomach empty except for gastric fluids. Many liver flukes, ducts filled with nematodes. Filamentous objects seen in left side of cerebrum (nerve fibers?) There were no obvious lesions that could point to a specific COD. Hepatic and pulmonary parasitism did not appear to be greater than normally noted in free-ranging harbor porpoises.

The line used was small-gauge nylon, and secured the right flipper to a large cleat on the dock. In addition, ca 55' of 3/8"" rope was found tied to the caudal peduncle. It appears likely that the animal was found floating dead in or near Bellingham Bay and was towed to Squalicum Harbor before being secured to the dock. It is unclear how long the animal had been secured to the dock, but the body cavity had been fully exposed by the action of scavengers (see photos, attached file). In addition, the body cavity, internal organs, and flesh around the thoracic cavity were very gas-filled and bloated. Finally, the line found tied to the caudal peduncle has considerable growth of macroalgae and encrusting invertebrates (Though this may have accumulated prior to the animal being secured to the dock). Attempts were made to dis-articulate the carcass and release the accumulated gasses. Once this was accomplished the carcass was sunk on-site below the unused dock (Which is inaccessible to the general public due to closure for long term construction project).","Harbor porpoise","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Phocoena phocoena",2011-09-01,0.234891,0.0312171,0.194404,0.202989,-0.075,1.1145478,-0.69,NA,NA,249.7771,14.861,NA,NA,"La Nina",-0.288,1.3941576,-0.37,NA,NA,131.2312,1.5001,NA,-1.704706,"La Nina",-1.392,0.59657425,-0.42,NA,NA,114.2945,-22.2926,NA,-0.184798,"La Nina",-1.511,1.202846,-0.69,NA,NA,-76.367,-177.7785,NA,6.117814,"La Nina",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.037526388,0.041118674,0.5062419,-0.18072183,-0.01779182,-0.18514676,0.4829406,-0.08690217,"Fall","Other"

Matt Klope responded and found that a Sheriff's Deputy had just dispatched the porpoise with a 45 caliber bullet to the head. Matt collected the fresh carcass and kept it on ice until the necropsy the following day. Necropsy performed by Dr. Stephanie Norman et al, on 4/22/12. COD gunshot. Cause of wound unknown. The porpoise was young, approx 1-2 years old, 122 cm, male in good nutritional condition. A 26 cm x 12 cm (average) wound was located on the top of the head/neck down to the muscle layer. Microscopic examination of the jagged edge of the wound revealed two tiny shark teeth (dogfish?). It is believed that the extensive head injury was caused by something else (unknown) and that the shark predated on the open wound. Tissue samples were collected for histopathology.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","0.215653067796595","-0.11379426229508","-122.68089","48.24068","Phocoena phocoena",2012-04-01,0.263308,0.0227416,0.150633,0.0521102,-0.993,0.8347008,-1.38,10.922,9.178,-8.3258,-126.6921,-1.25728,3.331843,"La Nina",-0.957,0.13322508,-1.79,10.791,10.002,91.3103,-16.9226,-2.22298,-0.721237,"La Nina",-0.949,0.3753989,-2.33,12.074,12.011,-10.4267,-99.002,-1.48637,2.506863,"La Nina",-0.933,1.2035096,-1.34,13.231,14.467,72.4988,-24.1888,-3.01452,0.201752,"La Nina",-0.72616,-1.178333333,-1.455076923,-1.059,-0.675615385,0.040041667,0.390884615,1.552478261,0.3437349,-0.19311549,0.024494445,0.10566089,0.94529414,-0.09529831,1.0478003,-0.035660878,"Spring","Other"

But it was a harbor porpoise. The carcass was located close to the high tide line, approx 1/2mile from the Rocky Point parking lot. Eagles and gulls had been scavenging on the carcass. Measurement from fluke notch to end of snout approx 70 inches. No visible injuries other than the scavenging holes. The rest of the body appeared to be in excellent condition. Via phone call with S. Dubpernell, it was decided to secure the carcass and protect it from further predators by covering with driftwood. The flukes were tied to logs higher up on the beach and the carcass was totally covered with driftwood. Necropsy planned for morning of 4/12/12. 4/12/12: Necropsy performed in situ by Dr. Stephanie Norman, assisted by Jill Hein, Mary jo Adams and Sandy Dubpernell. There were NSF on most of the organs. Mid liver on the left side of the right lobe on the medial surface was a 4.5 cm x 5.5 cm very firm lobulated mass. Sampled. There were also several enlarged bile ducts with thickened walls. A series of tissue samples were collected in formalin and frozen for histopathology. The female was pregnant and a 52.5 cm female fetus (approximately 2 months short of birth), was removed and frozen intact for further study.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","-0.0406169322033776","-0.0622442622950814","-122.42462","48.18913","Phocoena phocoena",2012-04-01,0.263308,0.0227416,0.150633,0.0521102,-0.993,0.8347008,-1.38,10.922,9.178,-8.3258,-126.6921,-1.25728,3.331843,"La Nina",-0.957,0.13322508,-1.79,10.791,10.002,91.3103,-16.9226,-2.22298,-0.721237,"La Nina",-0.949,0.3753989,-2.33,12.074,12.011,-10.4267,-99.002,-1.48637,2.506863,"La Nina",-0.933,1.2035096,-1.34,13.231,14.467,72.4988,-24.1888,-3.01452,0.201752,"La Nina",-0.72616,-1.178333333,-1.455076923,-1.059,-0.675615385,0.040041667,0.390884615,1.552478261,0.3437349,-0.19311549,0.024494445,0.10566089,0.94529414,-0.09529831,1.0478003,-0.035660878,"Spring","Other"

Carla Corin, SN volunteer, located the carcass early morning of 8/3/12, took pictures and marked location. SD responded to make accurate identification of this totally mummified carcass. The remains were broken into 3 sections- head, middle and fluke section. The 3 sections were ""reassembled"" on a driftwood log for approximation of length. All flesh was gone except for the flukes which were in good condition.(Fluke width 19 cm). It was verified as a harbor porpoise calf. All internal organs were gone. The head was mummified, had several holes and measured 13 cm in length from the tip of the snout to the center of the eye socket. Riba and acapula were gone.

From Level A field response: No obvious physical damage except for small puncture holes anterior of dorsal fin, looks like marks from gripper or possibly caused by a bird beak. Small amount of blood near head. Fecal matter (liquid, dark) around anus. From physical exam at time of necropsy: Slight scavenging around umbilical opening, fecal staining around anus, white froth coming from blowhole, no teeth erupted, skin sloughing slightly on left side - likely due to freezing and transport. Human Interaction Form completed: Signs of Human Interaction - No external signs of HI, froth in blowhole and lungs suggests drowning but succumbed due to unknown cause.

They had ""unburied"" the carcass which had been buried in the sand at the busy camp two days before. It was the carcass of a 92.5 cm harbor porpoise calf, male, badly scavenged. Eyes were gone, LFF and scapula gone. All organs missing from open thoracic and abdominal cavities caudal to UG slit. Body cavity contained only a few ribs, many broken and an intact vertebral column. The head was scavenged except for the very dorsal surface. The mandible was crushed and fell into several pieces. There were tooth buds only-no teeth had yet erupted. Blubber from the axial joint measured 7mm and was bright yellow. Flipper length was 18.5 cm. Fluke width 13 cm, estimate as tips were curled. Height of dorsal fin was 7 cm. Collected RFF and scapula for scientific study. Carcass was placed in the water for tidal removal.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","0.217703067796592","-0.0372842622950813","-122.68294","48.16417","Phocoena phocoena",2012-07-01,0.263308,0.0227416,0.150633,0.0521102,0.127,1.9255337,-0.27,10.913,10.011,55.0543,-42.6088,-1.4185,NA,"El Nino",-0.377,1.1173619,-1.05,9.882,8.743,-61.8093,-155.1543,0.91213,NA,"La Nina",-0.665,0.8632343,-0.85,10.327,9.168,78.4905,-74.96,-3.8569,2.395402,"La Nina",-0.993,0.8347008,-1.38,10.922,9.178,-8.3258,-126.6921,-1.25728,3.331843,"La Nina",-0.070041667,-0.72765,-1.333666667,-1.3729,-1.100333333,-0.970736842,-0.72616,-1.178333333,0.47127485,-0.18513009,0.47858506,-0.15929477,0.5321016,-0.19470818,0.3437349,-0.19311549,"Summer","Other"

The message was received at about 8:30 pm. Howard Garrett and Susan Berta returned to Fort Casey, arriving about 9pm. With fading light and rising tide, we made it to the porpoise site just before dark. We were able to determine that this was a second porpoise, though in similar condition to the first - highly scavenged and too decomposed to collect tissue samples. since we had to walk back in darkness and with a rising tide, we were able to only take a quick measurement and some photos, then tied the carcass to driftlogs. We returned the next afternoon, May 12, to further examine the carcass and take a blubber sample. KOMO 4 News came and covered the story. This was a larger porpoise, female, 58.5"", but too scavenged and decomposed to determine cause of death. The carcass was marked with a green grease pen ""X"" and left at the site (near the driftwood at high tide line )- the park was busy and most people were down at the waterline, so we left it where people would have less interaction with it, hoping the next tide would take it out. During a COASST walk on May 16, Jill Hein, Sandy Dubpernell, Kelly Zupich and Gary Donovan, Stranding Network responders, came upon the porpoise carcass left by Susan and Howard. SD noted that the skull and mandibles appeared to be intact. The skull and mandibles were then collected and frozen for further examination and cleaning for educational purposes.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","-0.0571969322033965","0.0333657377049192","-122.40804","48.09352","Phocoena phocoena",2012-05-01,0.263308,0.0227416,0.150633,0.0521102,-0.665,0.8632343,-0.85,10.327,9.168,78.4905,-74.96,-3.8569,2.395402,"La Nina",-0.993,0.8347008,-1.38,10.922,9.178,-8.3258,-126.6921,-1.25728,3.331843,"La Nina",-0.957,0.13322508,-1.79,10.791,10.002,91.3103,-16.9226,-2.22298,-0.721237,"La Nina",-0.949,0.3753989,-2.33,12.074,12.011,-10.4267,-99.002,-1.48637,2.506863,"La Nina",-1.100333333,-0.970736842,-0.72616,-1.178333333,-1.455076923,-1.059,-0.675615385,0.040041667,0.5321016,-0.19470818,0.3437349,-0.19311549,0.024494445,0.10566089,0.94529414,-0.09529831,"Spring","Other"

May possibly be same whale reported to NOAA floating ~100 mile off Cape Flattery by Canadian Coast Guard on 31 May. Drift patterns mapped by Canadian Coast Guard estimtated it would be heading south and east. Email from the Royal Canadian Navy below. I am one of the surveillance officers here at the Canadian Forces MARPAC HQ. I am emailing you in regards to the dead whale that you were inquiring about earlier this morning to the Op Centre Watch Floor. The flight crew that spotted the carcass surmised that it was a fin whale carcass, and it was spotted approx. 100 nm West of the mouth of Juan De Fuca Strait (Cape Flattery). It's location was 47 35 N 127 30W at about 10:00 AM on 31 May. Doing some regressive drift modelling going back 3 weeks, we determined that it had made it's way southbound before it was sighted, with the probability that it would continue on its southerly drift pattern. Drift modelling showed that it did not move very far south to the point where it was sighted given no windage effects. As for current position, we have not been able to ascertain its location since first and last sighting on 31 May. Please feel free to ask any questions if you have.

Susan Berta spoke to Robert, the carcass is 3' long, black with a white belly, so likely a harbor porpoise. It is rolling at the edge of the surf right in front of the parking lot. (this location is actually near Admirals Cove, not Ebey's Landing.) One eye is pecked out, but otherwise fresh and unscavenged. Howard Garrett was in Coupeville at the time and he was called to pick up the carcass. Robert said he would wait until someone got there and would pull the carcass up the beach to keep it from washing away. Howard picked up the porpoise. It was a female, 40"" long, (104 cm) freshly deceased, one eyeball pecked out and multiple gravel scratches, otherwise in good shape.

AA and JS responded. Fresh dead and mid-tide line. Jaw appeared split/degloved, scavenging around. Scratched along skin near head and left side body, some rake marks and scars present, froth coming from blowhole. Feces coming from rectum. Dark circular ""bruises"" on left and right flanks. Returned morning of 18-Mar for necropsy. External Comments: Scratches/rake marks particularly around left body, pec fin, and head, minimal scaring right side body. At response, scavenging left fluke, scavenging (moderate) left side head, left eye scavenged, left pec fin scavenged, dorsal fin tip scavenged. Think scratches on body mostly post-mortem (no hemorrhage underneath). Case Summary Necropsy: OPEN: Kidney extensive emphysema/crepitus around; 100 mL fluid in thoracic cavity; lungs aerated/spongy and right lung congested; based on other strandings of striped dolphin in Oregon and possibility of live stranding/drowning suspect possible Brucella or other infectious agent. Lab Results MICROSCOPIC: Central nervous system: Moderate to marked, lymphocytic inflammation is present primarily around blood vessels throughout the meninges of the spinal cord and brain and around blood vessels and Virchow-Robins spaces of the brain at all levels and in the white matter and gray matter tracts of the spinal cord. Inflammation also extends into and along the root ganglia. Some mild myelinic edema is noted in the white matter tracts primarily in the ventrolateral region of the spinal cord and in some of the root ganglia. Lymph node: Mild eosinophilic inflammation is in the medullary sinuses. Lung: The parenchyma is congested and edematous, and a single small focus of lymphohistiocytic/eosinophilic inflammation surrounds a bronchiole. Liver: Mild portal infiltrates of lymphocytes and eosinophils are noted. The following tissues are histologically within normal limits: kidney. HISTOPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 1. Marked nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis and root ganglioneuritis. 2. Acute pulmonary congestion and edema. 3. Mild eosinophilic inflammation, liver, lymph node, and lung. COMMENT: Histologic findings are consistent with an infectious disease process that has a tropism for the central nervous system. The morphologic features and distribution of the lesion are most suggestive of viral infection. The lesion lacks the microglial nodule formation typically associated with protozoan infection and the suppurative components typically associated with most bacterial infections. No viral inclusions are seen in any of the sections. This is a case in which immunohistochemistry and PCR are indicated to screen for some of the important viral infections and protozoan infections that occur in cetaceans. Please notify the laboratory if you would like ancillary procedures performed. This animal has acute features in the lung that are consistent with drowning. It has some mild eosinophilic inflammation in various tissues typical of the parasitism that is commonly encountered in while cetaceans and pinnipeds. No parasites are seen in the sections. Addendum, 3/31/14: Following email discourse with multiple participants, it is understood that the morbillivirus PCR and viral culture procedures are pending at U.C. Davis, and that pending these results, PCR and IHC from paraffin block for pathogens may be indicated. I have reviewed pathology reports (but not slides) for similar striped dolphin submissions to other institutions and suggest that these cases may represent the same disease process. UC Davis Results 4/14/2014: Negative for Morbillivirus testing. NVSL Brucella culture 4/28/2014: Culture positive in brain tissue but not lung. Addendum, 5/21/14: As per your request, block 2 has been forwarded for Brucella PCR (USDA). An addendum will follow. IHC results via NW Zoopath 8/12/2014: Negative for Brucella.","Striped dolphin","Inland_WA","48.1414415904762","-124.188283641509","0.476016358490568","-0.163458409523813","-124.6643","48.3049","Stenella coeruleoalba",2014-03-01,0.608195,0.359861,0.059999,0.00933975,-0.248,-1.4499235,-0.41,11.288,9.538,104.3454,3.2036,-4.08395,-0.686828,"La Nina",-0.053,-0.8050634,-0.11,12.924,11.609,63.6356,-29.1229,-2.31289,0.536857,"La Nina",0.13,-0.14863351,-0.87,11.048,14.253,132.3365,15.8949,-4.47547,-3.436425,"El Nino",-0.133,0.3874781,-0.48,13.911,16.042,86.0489,-37.976,-2.42601,1.192157,"La Nina",-0.958076923,-1.523,0.174384615,-0.361958333,-1.792115385,1.338478261,0.77528,2.435409091,0.3448111,-0.29551134,0.81532747,-0.36348164,0.58358365,-0.40314975,0.2440375,-0.65610045,"Spring","Dolphinidae"

It was a large porpoise slightly scavenged. On May 11, 2014, Mary Jo Adams investigated the carcass, but it required a tram to remove it from the beach. A team was mustered at 5pm and the carcass was carried by soft-stretcher off the beach with the assistance of RP Cooper. He had obtained easy access to the truck through private property (Surfcrest is a gated private community)to shorten the transport distance. The carcass was frozen for necropsy. Necropsy examination 6/21/14, by Dr, Stephanie Norman et al. Teeth were taken for the aging study, Morphometrics were recorded. No actual necropsy was performed due to the advanced stage of s decomposition and extensive scavenging of the carcass. (More scavenging by eagles occurred between sighting on May 10 and pickup on May 11.) Blubber samples were frozen in foil for toxins study. The skull was removed and will be sent to Baylor University for an ear plug study, after which the skull will be returned. The rest of the skeleton was flensed and frozen for educational purposes. The female was pregnant. A 67 cm long fetus was in the left horn. Male. Estimated at 4.8 kg. Estimated at being 3-4 weeks before birth. Amniotic fluid was collected. Fetus decomposing.

He pulled it from the water, iced and bagged it and transported it to Freeland, Orca Network, where the necropsy will be performed. The porpoise was estimated to be 40"" long, intact except for 2 scavenging holes in its jaw. The left eye orbit showed peck holes. The carcass was held on ice until necropsy on Oct 30. The necropsy was performed by Dr. S. Norman, Dr. B. Rickman and several assistants. Carcass was code 2+ with a slight odor. The entire left side showed evidence of superficial scavenging. The submandibular and mediastinal lymph nodes were prominant. Muscles appeared to be slightly spongy. A 24 cm section of colon was dark red to black in color. Collected for anaerobic and aerobidc bacterial culture (Phoemix Lab). Brain: meninges of caudal portion of cerebellum showed areas of blackened hemorrhage. The overlying calvarium showed hemorrhage at the ventral midline. Swabbed for bacterial culture. Tissue samples collected for histopathlogy. Extra sections of blubber, liver and kidney collected for Baylor University toxin study.

On the 29th Makah Fisheries, with help from Dan Greene, towed the whale to Neah Bay for further examination. On the 30th a necropsy was conducted. Based on the necropsy it is very likely that the whale died due to a shipstrike although not quickly. The flesh around injured area from ship strike was necrotic rather than bruised. This may have been because the whale lived through the injury and succombed to secondary bacterial infections from the injury. Stomach was empty. Bones and baleen were collected by Makah tribal members for cultural purposes pursuant to Makah Fisheries Annual Regulation 2014-2. Internal observations were similar to external observation that a large injury occurred to the left side of the dorsal surface of the whale. Tissue around the injury was very necrotic and friable. The rib immediately under where the injury occurred was broken, the ribs adjacent to the broken rib appeared normal. Stomach was mostly empty suggesting that the whale had not recently eaten before it died. Most of the internal organs were too necrotic and decomposed to be of much use for evaluation or histology. The samples will be provided to ZooPath in the future.","Minke whale","Inland_WA","48.1414415904762","-124.188283641509","0.0926163584905737","-0.16295840952381","-124.2809","48.3044","Balaenoptera acutorostrata",2014-09-01,0.608195,0.359861,0.059999,0.00933975,0.98,-0.41664875,0.82,10.926,13.533,387.6814,36.4109,-5.99021,-3.188611,"El Nino",0.976,0.22644207,1.8,11.643,13.419,196.983,1.4276,-5.52287,-0.799034,"El Nino",0.248,-0.6185479,1.13,11.794,10.906,106.1267,-17.0369,-3.73805,0.282857,"El Nino",0.032,-0.45546192,0.97,11.724,10.281,58.3447,-77.1942,-1.6011,2.579784,"El Nino",-0.12488,-0.158136364,0.574956522,1.125954545,0.810958333,0.16735,0.508333333,0.1651,-0.63630694,0.62403536,0.06328414,0.19031964,0.25525817,-0.100580096,0.2528573,-0.10432995,"Fall","Other"

Norman","Carcass located on Sep 21, 2014 around 11am about 1.2 miles north of Ebey's Landing beach parking lot. Found in mid-tidal area of beach and moved to high tide zone until pickup. Body showed scavenging holes around left eye and eye area. Lots of scrape marks all over body from rolling on pebbles and in the sand and possible claw or peck marks from scavenging birds. Otherwise the body was intact. The skin was scraped off a large area of the center left side. The carcass was carried off trhe beach around noon and placed into the cooler with ice around 1:30 pm. Delivered to SN headquarters in Freeland where it was kept on ice until necroposy on Sept. 23. There were NSF of the internal organs. Upon opening the skull for examination of the brain, the ventral brain stem was surrounded by hemorrhage extending to the ventral base of the skull and surrounding the entire caudal part of the cerebellum. Hemorrhage was also found deep into the atlas/axis area. Hemorrhage is on the right side of deep connective tissue beneath the blubber by C1 and C2 and surrounding the spinal cord. Update from J. Higgins: I received photos from Susan from the day that they got the stranding report, they collected and examined at least one day later. In the original photos you can clearly see monofilament impressions around the head and rostrum, but by the time they examined the animal themselves they could not see them anymore due to skin cracking and sloughing. I reviewed the photos with Stephanie Norman later (she had done the necropsy) and she agreed that it was an entanglement case based on the impressions in the photos, even though they did not see them at the necropsy.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","0.27126306779661","-0.0746442622950809","-122.7365","48.20153","Phocoena phocoena",2014-09-01,0.608195,0.359861,0.059999,0.00933975,0.98,-0.41664875,0.82,10.926,13.533,387.6814,36.4109,-5.99021,-3.188611,"El Nino",0.976,0.22644207,1.8,11.643,13.419,196.983,1.4276,-5.52287,-0.799034,"El Nino",0.248,-0.6185479,1.13,11.794,10.906,106.1267,-17.0369,-3.73805,0.282857,"El Nino",0.032,-0.45546192,0.97,11.724,10.281,58.3447,-77.1942,-1.6011,2.579784,"El Nino",-0.12488,-0.158136364,0.574956522,1.125954545,0.810958333,0.16735,0.508333333,0.1651,-0.63630694,0.62403536,0.06328414,0.19031964,0.25525817,-0.100580096,0.2528573,-0.10432995,"Fall","Other"

The fetus was very recently aborted and traces of the umbilicus were still visible. John believes they witnessed the first of surfacing of the mother after abortion. The presumed mother, K27, surfaced after a long dive seen pushing the fetus for a single surfacing run, and then the fetus was not visable.

A full necropsy was performed by Dr Stephanie Norman and assistants on Sept. 15, 2017. It was a female calf 93 cm in length, weighing 15.8 kg.There were no significant findings in the internal organs. There was a small wound on top of the rostrum and another by the genital slit. Sub Q dark red/black staining of tissue around blow hole, likely a hematoma. There was additional hemorrhage around the left scapula and blood and edema in the ventral neck area. Plus approximately 15 ml of dark red fluid in the thoracic cavity. COD was undeetermined, but possibly blunt force trauma, possibly by orca interaction.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA","48.1268857377049","-122.465236932203","0.0757630677966148","0.132885737704918","-122.541","47.994","Phocoena phocoena",2017-08-01,0.357637,0.0151836,0.0400024,0.00226169,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summer","Other"
