Adrianne Akmajian (Makah Fisheries) met Bob at the scene and collected the carcass for necropsy. Adrianne transported the carcass to the WDFW lab in Lakewood, WA to perform the necropsy. Necropsy performed at WDFW based on desire to take sterile brain samples in culture media (primarily to test for protozoal parasites) which we do not have the capacity for at the Makah lab.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA",0.531282222222231,0.0111254444444455,-124.439,48.1378,48.1489254444444,-123.907717777778

Lungs had blood in them with a lot of bubbles (froth) coming from the bronchioles - look similar to spit bug masses. Photos were taken as well as samples for histology that will be sent to Dr. Raverty. Raverty results: lack of milk suggests not nursing. Massive hemorrhage in adrenal gland is similar to finding in adults with protozoal infection from Sarcocystis neurona or Toxoplasma gondii however IHC staining showed no detectable parasites. Another possibility suggested was a septicemia.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA",0.749782222222223,-0.156574555555558,-124.6575,48.3055,48.1489254444444,-123.907717777778

Small amount of blood near head. Fecal matter (liquid, dark) around anus. From physical exam at time of necropsy: Slight scavenging around umbilical opening, fecal staining around anus, white froth coming from blowhole, no teeth erupted, skin sloughing slightly on left side - likely due to freezing and transport. Human Interaction Form completed: Signs of Human Interaction - No external signs of HI, froth in blowhole and lungs suggests drowning but succumbed due to unknown cause.

Necropsy findings: Based on the apparent age of this animal (neonate)), the accumulation of aspirated squames and meconium throughout the lungs is suggestive of a fetal distress type syndrome, possibly related to dystochia, premature placental detachment or some other process. Failure to suckle may be related to a nonviable neonate, maternal neglect or loss. The mild to moderate depletion of copper, manganese and zinc and profound lack of vitamin A within the liver further substantiates in utero malnutrition.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA",-0.185847945205481,-0.0526047945205477,-122.354,48.198,48.1453952054795,-122.539847945205

They discovered it 100 feet from the stairs to the beach at Double Bluff Park,Freeland wrapped in seaweed. They had plastic trash bags with them so packed it in the bags and left it near the steps while responders headed down to collect it. Upon examination,responders found a harbor porpoise calf in good condition. A few small scrapes and one cut, or possible scavenger peck on the left jaw and some skin beginning to peel.There was a foamy discharge coming from the blowhole. A small sample of that was collected in a syringe. The porpoise was put on ice in a large cooler awaiting necropsy scheduled for July 10. Necropsy July 10, 2009. Age neonate. 87 cm from tip of snout to fluke notch. Girth at front of dorsal fin: 46.9 cm. Blubber: dorsal 1 cm, lateral 1.3 cm, ventral 1.4 cm. Blubber samples frozen for Brad Hanson , MML, and Pace Labs for dioxin testing. Good post mortem condition. Scavenging on neck and left eye. Poor nutritional condition. Flukes and dorsal fin still folded. No parasites noted. Teeth not yet erupted. Pink tinged foam coming from blowhole.o Primary incision: thorax contained red-tinged clearish fluid, apprx 5 ml. Blubber yellow, icteric. Foam in airways. Trachea contained small amount yellow tinged foam. Lungs floated. Stomach contents: meconium. Collected and frozen. Bladder empty. Comments: caldftook breaths. Umbilical stump still attached. No evidence of nursing. Calf approx 1-2 days old. No gross visible signs of trauma, infection or other physical abnormalities. Cause of dearth:unknown. Complete sets of tissues collected frozen and formalin for analysis. Necropsy results from Dr. Norman: poor nutritional condition. Neonate had taken breath before expiring. Necropsy results from Dr. Raverty: the aspirated squames and meconiom are suggestive of fetal distress type syndrome and in conjunction with the lack of ingesta in the gastrointestinal tract, would have been sufficiently severe to account for the lack of this neonate.

Responders arrived on the scene at approx 11;45 and the porpoise was about 5' from the water's edge, floating upright, but no longer moving. The mouth was slightly ajar. They brought it to the beach and confirmed that it had died. The neighbors who had seen it earlier that morning reported it as alive and swimming in circles near the beach at 10:54 AM. They took photos at that time which they will send to CPSMMSN. A neighbor said he had seen it yesterday swimming around in the same area.

The description sounded similar to the first porpoise with a lot of scavenging - but the location of the carcass caused us to believe this was a second animal. The message was received at about 8:30 pm. Howard Garrett and Susan Berta returned to Fort Casey, arriving about 9pm. With fading light and rising tide, we made it to the porpoise site just before dark. We were able to determine that this was a second porpoise, though in similar condition to the first - highly scavenged and too decomposed to collect tissue samples. since we had to walk back in darkness and with a rising tide, we were able to only take a quick measurement and some photos, then tied the carcass to driftlogs. We returned the next afternoon, May 12, to further examine the carcass and take a blubber sample. KOMO 4 News came and covered the story. This was a larger porpoise, female, 58.5"", but too scavenged and decomposed to determine cause of death. The carcass was marked with a green grease pen ""X"" and left at the site (near the driftwood at high tide line )- the park was busy and most people were down at the waterline, so we left it where people would have less interaction with it, hoping the next tide would take it out. During a COASST walk on May 16, Jill Hein, Sandy Dubpernell, Kelly Zupich and Gary Donovan, Stranding Network responders, came upon the porpoise carcass left by Susan and Howard. SD noted that the skull and mandibles appeared to be intact. The skull and mandibles were then collected and frozen for further examination and cleaning for educational purposes.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA",-0.131847945205479,0.0518752054794547,-122.408,48.09352,48.1453952054795,-122.539847945205

A team was mustered at 5pm and the carcass was carried by soft-stretcher off the beach with the assistance of RP Cooper. He had obtained easy access to the truck through private property (Surfcrest is a gated private community)to shorten the transport distance. The carcass was frozen for necropsy. Necropsy examination 6/21/14, by Dr, Stephanie Norman et al. Teeth were taken for the aging study, Morphometrics were recorded. No actual necropsy was performed due to the advanced stage of s decomposition and extensive scavenging of the carcass. (More scavenging by eagles occurred between sighting on May 10 and pickup on May 11.) Blubber samples were frozen in foil for toxins study. The skull was removed and will be sent to Baylor University for an ear plug study, after which the skull will be returned. The rest of the skeleton was flensed and frozen for educational purposes. The female was pregnant. A 67 cm long fetus was in the left horn. Male. Estimated at 4.8 kg. Estimated at being 3-4 weeks before birth. Amniotic fluid was collected. Fetus decomposing.

Body showed scavenging holes around left eye and eye area. Lots of scrape marks all over body from rolling on pebbles and in the sand and possible claw or peck marks from scavenging birds. Otherwise the body was intact. The skin was scraped off a large area of the center left side. The carcass was carried off trhe beach around noon and placed into the cooler with ice around 1:30 pm. Delivered to SN headquarters in Freeland where it was kept on ice until necroposy on Sept. 23. There were NSF of the internal organs. Upon opening the skull for examination of the brain, the ventral brain stem was surrounded by hemorrhage extending to the ventral base of the skull and surrounding the entire caudal part of the cerebellum. Hemorrhage was also found deep into the atlas/axis area. Hemorrhage is on the right side of deep connective tissue beneath the blubber by C1 and C2 and surrounding the spinal cord. Update from J. Higgins: I received photos from Susan from the day that they got the stranding report, they collected and examined at least one day later. In the original photos you can clearly see monofilament impressions around the head and rostrum, but by the time they examined the animal themselves they could not see them anymore due to skin cracking and sloughing. I reviewed the photos with Stephanie Norman later (she had done the necropsy) and she agreed that it was an entanglement case based on the impressions in the photos, even though they did not see them at the necropsy.","Harbor porpoise","Inland_WA",0.196652054794527,-0.0561347945205455,-122.7365,48.20153,48.1453952054795,-122.539847945205

The wound is 44cm at its longest and 24cm at its widest. The skin about the wound is starting to slough off. There is another wound at the end of the jawline, likely also from scavenging.

It appears likely that the animal was found floating dead in or near Bellingham Bay and was towed to Squalicum Harbor before being secured to the dock. It is unclear how long the animal had been secured to the dock, but the body cavity had been fully exposed by the action of scavengers (see photos, attached file). In addition, the body cavity, internal organs, and flesh around the thoracic cavity were very gas-filled and bloated. Finally, the line found tied to the caudal peduncle has considerable growth of macroalgae and encrusting invertebrates (Though this may have accumulated prior to the animal being secured to the dock).

Mike and I helped load the adult, female Pp into the back of Dr. Raverty's pickup truck for transport. No other visible signs of trauma on the carcass or fins. The pectoral fins were starting to peal from exposure. On 8-12-06, Dr. Raverty sent an e-mail stating that the Pp died of a severe fungal infection in her lungs due to Cryptococcus gattii. Dr. Raverty will have a more complete report on the Pp this next week. I called Lynne Barre, Dr. S. Norman, Susan B., Birch Bay State Park Ranger, Jason and the reporting party Nancy K., to notify them of the possible health hazard of the Harbor Porpoises. Also, if any other porpoises should show up in the area, to call me immediately.
